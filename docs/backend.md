**Why did I choose BTB language instead of C++?**

Because I like it and I need to test it on a standalone project.
Performance in the backend code will not be a problem.
The job managing code will do little computation, it's the jobs themselves that take time so
the choice of language is purely based on preference.

Also, BTB can be compiled on Linux and Windows with ease. I can't say the same about C++.
