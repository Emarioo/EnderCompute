The interface design.

# Prototype
Let's begin with a first iteration.

**Our needs**:
- Feature to create, edit, and remove jobs.
- Running any kind of process.
- Supplying process with arguments and files.
- Seeing jobs to run, that are running, and that have run.
- Information about who started a job, multiple users may use the system.
- Information about when it was scheduled, when it began running and when it finished.
- Ability to see the output of finished jobs.

**Nice but not essential features for now**
- Ability to pause jobs that are running, delay jobs that will run.
- Ability to categorize jobs based on failure and success.
